Assignment 1 — The Ages Table
What You’re Going to Do

We’re going to make a tiny database that remembers people’s names and ages.
Think of it like a digital notebook.



Step 1 — Open phpMyAdmin in XAMPP

Open XAMPP Control Panel.

Click Start next to Apache and MySQL.

Open your browser and type:

http://localhost/phpmyadmin

→ This opens a website that lets you talk to your database.



Step 2 — Create a New Database

In phpMyAdmin, click Databases → Create new database.

Type demo_db as the name.

Choose utf8mb4_general_ci for “Collation.”

Click Create.

This is like opening a brand-new notebook where we’ll write our table.



Step 3 — Create the “Ages” Table

Click on your new database (demo_db).

Click the SQL tab (top menu).

Paste this code and press Go:

CREATE TABLE Ages (
  name VARCHAR(128),
  age INTEGER
);

This makes a table with two boxes:

name for the person’s name

age for their age



Step 4 — Add Data (the People)

Now let’s write inside our table.

Paste and run this:

DELETE FROM Ages;
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Akam', 13);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Oisin', 21);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Mhirren', 34);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Aleeshmah', 25);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Nana', 33);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Blythe', 28);

You just added 6 people! 🎉



Step 5 — See What’s Inside

Run: 

SELECT * FROM Ages;

Now you’ll see a list of names and ages.

You can also sort them by age:

SELECT * FROM Ages ORDER BY age DESC;



Step 6 — (Optional) Make a Secret Code

If you want to make a “magic number” out of each person’s name + age, try:

SELECT HEX(MD5(CONCAT(name, age))) AS code FROM Ages ORDER BY code LIMIT 1;

That makes a unique hash (like a fingerprint) for your data.

Step 7 — Save Your Work

Click Export → SQL or Export → JSON to download your table.
Now you can upload it to GitHub or share it with a friend.
