🧩 M3 – Relational Schema Design & Normalization

Folder: m3-schema-and-normalization
Focus: Designing database schemas using relational principles to support scalable, real-world data structures.

⸻

🎯 Overview

This module focused on database design thinking—laying the foundation for building normalized, relational systems. I explored how to model real-world entities using primary keys, foreign keys, and entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), along with planning 1:1, 1:N, and N:M relationships across tables. Though this was a no-code module, the conceptual groundwork was essential for future implementation and querying.

🛠️ Core Concepts

Defining primary and foreign keys to structure relationships

Designing for 1:1, 1:N, and N:M cardinality

Building ERDs to visually plan schemas before coding

Applying normalization to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity

Mapping schema diagrams to real-world systems (e.g., inventory, user roles, simulation entities)

🧠 Key Insights

“Structure before syntax.”
This module emphasized that good schema design prevents future query chaos. A well-normalized structure leads to readable, scalable, and error-resistant SQL—especially when joining across multiple tables.

💡 Reflection

While no SQL code was written, this module transformed how I think about data. I saw how even complex environments (like XR training simulations or healthcare scenarios) can be modeled cleanly with normalized table structures. I now approach backend planning with schema-first thinking, using ERDs to ensure every entity and interaction is accounted for before writing a single query.
