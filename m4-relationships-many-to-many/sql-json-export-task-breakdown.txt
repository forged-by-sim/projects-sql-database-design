XAMPP Setup Steps (for Windows)
1. Start Services

In your XAMPP Control Panel:

Click Start next to Apache

Click Start next to MySQL
You should see both turning green. 





2.  Open phpMyAdmin

Open your browser

Go to: http://localhost/phpmyadmin




Step-by-Step: Create and Select the Correct Database
1.	Go to the phpMyAdmin home page

In the left panel, click on "New" just under the phpMyAdmin logo.

2. Create the new database

In the "Create database" field, type exactly:

roster

Leave collation as default (or choose utf8_general_ci).

Click Create.

You should now see the new database named roster appear on the left panel.




Step 2: Select the roster Database

Click on roster in the left sidebar.

Then click the SQL tab at the top.





Step 3: Paste in the SQL Code

Once you're in the SQL tab of the roster database, paste in this code (just the first block to test):

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Member;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `User`;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Course;

CREATE TABLE `User` (
    user_id     INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name        VARCHAR(128) UNIQUE,
    PRIMARY KEY(user_id)
) ENGINE=InnoDB CHARACTER SET=utf8;

CREATE TABLE Course (
    course_id     INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title         VARCHAR(128) UNIQUE,
    PRIMARY KEY(course_id)
) ENGINE=InnoDB CHARACTER SET=utf8;

CREATE TABLE Member (
    user_id       INTEGER,
    course_id     INTEGER,
    role          INTEGER,
    CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES `User` (user_id)
      ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES Course (course_id)
      ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, course_id)
) ENGINE=InnoDB CHARACTER SET=utf8;

Then click Go.

You should see “Query OK” and all 3 tables created.



Once you see that message:

MySQL returned an empty result set (i.e. zero rows).

is exactly what we want when creating tables. It's saying:

✅ The query ran with no errors

✅ The tables User, Course, and Member were successfully created

🚫 No data was inserted (yet), which is expected at this step





Next Step: Insert the Data

Now let’s add the actual user, course, and member info.

Make sure you’re still in the roster database

Go to the SQL tab again

Paste this SQL code and click Go:

-- Insert Users
INSERT INTO `User` (name) VALUES
('Blaine'), ('Kady'), ('Maighdlin'), ('Mali'), ('Zeynep'),
('Dion'), ('Bogdan'), ('Danica'), ('Ruo'), ('Savannah'),
('Kadyn'), ('Chahat'), ('Elyana'), ('Emaan'), ('Rafif');

-- Insert Courses
INSERT INTO Course (title) VALUES
('si106'), ('si110'), ('si206');

-- Insert Members
-- si106
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 1 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Blaine' AND c.title = 'si106';
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 0 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Kady' AND c.title = 'si106';
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 0 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Maighdlin' AND c.title = 'si106';
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 0 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Mali' AND c.title = 'si106';
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 0 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Zeynep' AND c.title = 'si106';

-- si110
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 1 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Dion' AND c.title = 'si110';
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 0 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Bogdan' AND c.title = 'si110';
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 0 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Danica' AND c.title = 'si110';
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 0 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Ruo' AND c.title = 'si110';
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 0 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Savannah' AND c.title = 'si110';

-- si206
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 1 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Kadyn' AND c.title = 'si206';
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 0 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Chahat' AND c.title = 'si206';
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 0 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Elyana' AND c.title = 'si206';
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 0 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Emaan' AND c.title = 'si206';
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role)
SELECT u.user_id, c.course_id, 0 FROM `User` u, Course c WHERE u.name = 'Rafif' AND c.title = 'si206';

You should see green “Query OK” messages for each section.






After That: Let’s Export to JSON!

Once the data is in:

Click roster in the left sidebar again

Go to the Export tab

Select:

Custom – display all possible options

Format: JSON

Save output to file

Uncheck “pretty print”

Click Go and download roster.json
