Assignment 2 — Final SQL Normalization Project (Roster)
What You’re Going to Do

Now we’ll make a real database like a teacher’s gradebook.
It’ll remember:

who the students are,

which classes exist, and

who teaches which class.



Step 1 — Open phpMyAdmin

Same as before:

Open XAMPP → start Apache + MySQL

Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin



Step 2 — Create a New Database

Click Databases → Create new database

Call it roster

Click Create



Step 3 — Create the Tables

Paste and run:

CREATE TABLE User (
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(128) UNIQUE,
  PRIMARY KEY(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Course (
  course_id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  title VARCHAR(128) UNIQUE,
  PRIMARY KEY(course_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Member (
  user_id INTEGER,
  course_id INTEGER,
  role INTEGER,
  PRIMARY KEY(user_id, course_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES User(user_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES Course(course_id)
);

Now we have three tables like Lego blocks:

User = people

Course = classes

Member = connection between them



Step 4 — Add Some Users

INSERT INTO User (name) VALUES
('Jane'), ('Ed'), ('Sue'), ('Sally'), ('Bob');




Step 5 — Add Some Courses

INSERT INTO Course (title) VALUES
('si106'), ('si110'), ('si206');




Step 6 — Connect Them (Who is in What)

INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES
(1, 1, 1),
(2, 1, 0),
(3, 1, 0),
(4, 1, 0),
(5, 1, 0);


(You can add more if you like.)

role = 1 means teacher

role = 0 means student





Step 7 — Look at Everything

SELECT User.name, Course.title, Member.role
FROM User
JOIN Member ON User.user_id = Member.user_id
JOIN Course ON Member.course_id = Course.course_id
ORDER BY Course.title, User.name;


This is like asking:

“Hey database, show me all the students and teachers for every class.”




Step 8 — Save as JSON

In phpMyAdmin, click your database name (roster)

Click Export → Format: JSON → Go

It saves a file like roster.json

This file shows your whole database neatly, like:

{"course":[{"course_id":"1","title":"si106"}]}





Step 9 — Done!

You’ve just:
✅ Created 3 connected tables
✅ Linked them with foreign keys
✅ Queried them with JOIN
✅ Exported to JSON

You’ve basically done Database Normalization — organizing information so nothing is duplicated.
