⚙️ M1 – SQL Environment Setup & Installation

Folder: m1-sql-setup-and-env
Focus: Preparing a local SQL environment using SQLite, MySQL, and DB Browser to run queries outside of a browser-based sandbox.

⸻

🎯 Overview

This module laid the foundation for running SQL code independently of a browser. I installed tools like SQLite and DB Browser, configured them for local database testing, and practiced basic command-line interactions. This setup allowed for greater flexibility when testing queries and understanding relational databases beyond the course sandbox.

🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

Installing and configuring SQLite and MySQL engines

Setting up XAMPP/MAMP for local server simulation

Using VS Code to write .sql and .txt scripts

Running SQL queries using DB Browser for SQLite

Navigating the terminal/command line to interact with databases

⸻

🧪 Tools Used

SQLite – Lightweight, file-based SQL engine used for practice

MySQL – Installed via XAMPP (or MAMP) for server-style environments

DB Browser for SQLite – GUI to explore tables, run SQL, and view output

VS Code – Code editor for writing and organizing SQL scripts

📎 Notes

There was no formal graded assignment for this module, but it was crucial to ensuring everything ran smoothly in later modules. I initially skipped setting up MySQL via MAMP/XAMPP but returned to it for cross-platform testing in Module 2. For my core workflow, I relied on:

SQLite as my engine

VS Code for clean editing

DB Browser for fast visual query results
