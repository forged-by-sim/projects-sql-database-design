🧭 About This Repository

This repository showcases my foundational SQL journey — from writing basic queries to modeling relational schemas and exporting normalized data as JSON. Each module builds toward real-world readiness, focusing on data integrity, cross-engine flexibility, and backend interoperability.

📌 Highlighted Projects
🔹 m2-select-and-filtering/ages-table-project

Created a table with name–age pairs and wrote filtered queries to extract the first alphabetical entry. Demonstrated compatibility across SQLite and MySQL engines. Includes screenshots and version-specific scripts.

🔹 m4-relationships-many-to-many/schema-json-exports-project

Constructed a many-to-many relationship between users and courses using a junction table. Queried results and exported to JSON format, simulating real-world API-ready workflows. Includes full schema, screenshots, and formatted JSON.

💡 What I Gained

Schema-first thinking: I now design before I query.

Cross-platform awareness: SQLite ≠ MySQL — I practiced syntax flexibility and validation.

Structured exports: Bridging relational logic with modern data formats like JSON

Real-world simulation parallels: These workflows reflect how backend systems in simulation/XR training environments operate behind the scenes.

💬 Final Reflection

This repo marks the moment I stopped seeing SQL as a “course” and started using it as a design tool — to shape data the way simulations, user dashboards, and analytics engines demand it. This isn’t just academic — it’s personal, professional, and practical.
